            Qi Wireless Charging with a wireless energy transfer of up to 5 <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip"
              title="Unit of power ">watt</a>

            Qi (the Chinese word for “energy flow“, pronounced like the “chee“ in “cheese“) is the universal standard
            for wireless charging of battery opererated devices like cell phones, iPods, MP3 players and cameras.
            The wireless power transfer occurs through electromagnetic induction. With inductive charging the required
            power reaches the device not through a traditional cable but rather wirelessly through the use of
            electromagnetic fields. The principle is very simple: the Qi Sender (Charging Station) transfers the
            required energy to the Qi receiver (the mobile phone).

          </p>
          <h3>
            What is the point of wireless charging?
          </h3>

          <p>
            The biggest advantage of Qi Wireless Charging technology is that cell phones and chargers from different
            manufactures are compatible. The only requirement is that both parts – the sender and the receiver – fulfil
            the Qi specifications.
            Therefore, every Qi enabled device is compatible with every Qi charging transmitter, regardless of the
            manufacturer or make of the device. Numerous cell phones, including from market leaders like Nokia, Samsung,
            Sony, LG, Motorola and HTC,already comply with the Qi standard and can therefore be charged by any Qi
            Charging Station. The number of enabled devices is constantly growing as Qi wireless charging technology is
            integrated by an ever-expanding list of manufacturers. This allows you to charge your various battery
            operated electronic devices with just a single charging station.

          <h1>How does Qi Wireless Charging work?</h1>
          <img src="../res/img/wireless-charging (3).jpg">
          <p>
            It’s based on the principle of induction

            Wireless Charging isn’t really a completely new product. Electric toothbrushes have been using the
            principles of inductive charging for many years. Qi Wireless Charging uses a resonant inductive coupling
            between the sender (the charging station) and the reciever (the mobile device). A regular test signal is
            sent by the sender to check for a capacity or resonance change, telling the Qi enabled charger base that a
            qi compatible phone is present. The sender modulates the charge and checks for compatibility to the Qi
            standard.

            Once Qi compatibility and the energy requirement have been calculated, the charging through induction
            begins. During the charging the sender and receiver remain in contact and switch into standby mode as soon
            as the battery is fully charged. Another advantage of the Qi charger base is that it only activates and
            transfers energy when an enabled device requiring charging is placed upon it.

            With this technology the electromagnetic coils that send and receive the charge are especially shielded to
            reduce electromagnetic rays.</p>

            Is Wireless Charging worth it?
          </h1>
          <h3>
            How convenient would it be to have a single charger for all your phones, iPods, MP3 players, cameras and not
            even need annoying cables?
          </h3>
          <p>

            As endless new smartphones cover the world battery running times have become shorter. Every make, sometimes
            even every device, has its own special charger. When you get a new device you need a new compatible charger.
            You quickly find yourself with a confusing pile of different chargers.
            No more different chargers, no cable spaghetti, no empty batteries are only some of the advantages of
            wireless charging.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Sounds too good to be true?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Not with the Qi Wireless charging solutions from Qinside! Imagine a cable free qi docking station for all Qi
            compatible phones. Forget all those different chargers and cable spaghetti and have them “share“ a single
            charger base at home, in the office or on the go.

            Imagine lounges, waiting rooms, airports, train stations, bars and restaurants with Qi enabled charging
            stations seamlessly integrated into the furniture.

            You can charge your devices at any time, whatever the make, model or manufacturer.

            The only requirement is a Qi compatible device or the use of the Qi Receiver Qi2001 for iPhone 4 - iPhone 6
            plus and all phones with Micro-USB connections.

            Quickly and simply charge your devices with a wireless power transfer of up to 5 watt.

            Empty batteries in cell phones, iPods, MP3 players and cameras will be a thing of the past!

            Is wireless charging harmful?

          <img src="../res/img/wireless-charging (1).jpg">
          <p>
            Expert opinions are divided. On one side, many scientists confirm that the small amount of electromagnetic
            radiation that is emitted by Wireless Charging is harmless. Others speak of a very harmful radiation that
            can have a negative impact on the human body.
          </p>
          <h3>

            How much electromagnetic radiation is emitted by the Qi Wireless Charging System?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Insignificantly little.

            The principle of Qi has been used in electronic toothbrushes for years without any known physical effects on
            human health. Due to the low range of the Qi wireless charging technology, the electromagnetic radiation is
            severely limited.

            Electromagnetic radiation exists only in the immediate area of the Qi wireless charging station and only
            when a device is placed there. The release of electromagnetic rays is further reduced by additional
            shielding in the sending and receiving coils of the Qi standard.

            Wireless Power Consortium

          <h3>
            The aim of introducing an international standard for Wireless Charging
          </h3>

          <p>
            The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) was established on the 17th December 2008 and in the same year adopted
            Qi as the single standard for inductive charging. The introduction of Qi as the global standard enables
            universal inductive charging for all Qi compatible electronic devices.

            That means that every Qi compatible device can be charged on every Qi compatible charging station. The
            Wireless Power Consortium, with 250 members including market leaders Samsung, Nokia, LG, Panasonic, HTC,
            Sony, Microsoft, Ikea and Motorola, is the biggest union of manufacturers for cable free, inductive
            charging.

            “Due to the increase of Qi products, it is important to ensure that all wireless chargers work correctly
            with all mobile devices” says WPC Chairman Menno Treffers “the continually updated database created by
            Testronic makes it easy to determine whether a new product will be compatible with previously certified
            products.”

            “In our view the introduction of the Qi Standard is one of the most important technical developments for
            users of mobile devices such as phones, tablets and other devices that are now used everyday in our work and
            private lives“ says Johan Craeyback, Chief Technology Officer at Testronic Labs.

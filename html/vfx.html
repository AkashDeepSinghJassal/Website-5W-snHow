            In filmmaking, visual effects (abbreviated VFX) are the processes by which imagery is created and/or
            manipulated outside the context of a live action shot. Visual effects involve the integration of live-action
            footage and generated imagery to create environments which look realistic, but would be dangerous,
            expensive, impractical, or simply impossible to capture on film. Visual effects using computer generated
            imagery have recently become accessible to the independent filmmaker with the introduction of affordable and
            easy-to-use animation and compositing software.

            From creating some cool matte paintings in Photoshop and then adding some camera animation using After
            Effects or Nuke or any other compositing softwares to high end dynamics simulations like fluid effects,
            destruction, explosions and various other particle dynamics using the softwares like Houdini, Real Flow etc
            etc..

            o overall, some of the industry standard softwares for used for visual effects productions are..

            Maya, 3ds Max, c4d, blender, zbrush, 3d coat, modo, mari, marvelous designer silo etc for 3d modelling,
            sculpting, texturing, rendering, animation along with Vray, Arnold, Maxwell etc for Lighting and final
            rendering..

            Mocha, 3d equalizer, PFTrack, Boujou, Syntheyes, SilhouetteFX for camera tracking, match moving, object
            removing, clean plating, rotoscopy etc etc..

            Houdini, Real Flow, FumeX, Krakatoa, along with Maya’s own Dynamics and many other Particle and Dynamics
            software and 3rd party plugins for Dynamics and Particle Simulation

            Vue, World Machine, City Engine for world and terrain creation..

            and lastly for compositing Nuke, Fusion, Composite, After Effects etc etc..

            What is Difference between SFX and VFX?
          </h1>

          <p>
            SFX – Special Effects
            VFX – Visual Effects

            SFX are done ‘in camera,’ that is to say they actually, physically happen. If you drop a match in a can of
            petrol and record the resultant explosion, that’s SFX. If you build a prosthetic arm, then attach it to your
            actor then have it ripped off and blood spurt out, that’s SFX. So are gunshot wounds, firing blanks,
            stabbing people etc.

            VFX are done in post-production, through the power of a computer. If you create a computer model of a
            spaceship and fly it across the background of your scene, that’s VFX. If you greenscreen an actor to make it
            look like he’s falling from a plane, that’s VFX. Now, these days, VFX is often cheaper than SFX so often
            explosions, spurting blood and muzzle-flashes are done as VFX.

            1. Layout Artist
          </h3>

          <p>
            Usually part of the pre-production and previsualization process, a layout artist, as the name suggests, lays
            the foundations for how the visuals will eventually look. Typically, a layout artist is tasked with
            interpreting the script and storyboard and creating templates for how to transfer the script or storyboard
            into the visual medium. Everything from scene creation to camera angles and more falls under this remit.
          </p>

          <h3>
            2. Compositing Artist
          </h3>

          <p>
            Well done visual effects merge seamlessly with the rest of the background, and don’t distract the viewing
            experience at all. One glitch though, and it can ruin the entire experience for the viewer. A compositor’s
            job is to ensure that this seamlessness between VFX and live action is intact, and any visual disturbances
            are eliminated.
          </p>

          <h3>
            3. Lighting Artist
          </h3>

          <p>
            Lighting is one of the most crucial aspects of any film production – live action or animated. A lighting
            artist is in charge of understanding the behavior of light and its interaction with real world subjects and
            translating that into the visual effects world. Lighting plays a very important role in visual continuity
            and even the storytelling process, and a lighting artist has to be able to deliver the perfect amount of
            illumination to make a scene pop.
          </p>

          <h3>
            4. Rendering Artist
          </h3>

          <p>
            When it comes to VFX career opportunities in India, rendering artists are in high demand across major VFX
            studios and production houses. In a similar vein to lighting artists, rendering artists are responsible for
            turning the 3D models into the real world-esque visuals we see on the screen. A delicate and highly
            technical job, rendering artists make sure that the project is transformed from an idea to a visual.
          </p>

          <h3>
            5. Roto Artist
          </h3>

          <p>
            A rotoscoping artist or roto artist has the difficult and imperative task of tracing all those areas of a
            frame where CG meets real life, in order to provide compositors with a framework from which to begin their
            work. A job that offers great foundation in VFX, and often a starting point for VFX professionals, there is
            a great demand for roto artists today.
          </p>

          <h3>
            6. Matte Painter
          </h3>

          <p>
            You know those beautiful, almost magical tapestries that only VFX films seem to have? A matte painter has a
            huge hand in their creation. A matte artist takes visual reference cues such as photographs, sketches and
            other references and turns them into realistic VFX scenes that all the action will take place in.
          </p>

          <h3>
            7. Match Mover Artist
          </h3>

          <p>
            A match mover is typically an expert in both 2D and 3D as he or she has to work at the confluence of both
            worlds. An artist that works in CGI, tracking movements is an important part of the match mover’s
            responsibilities, as in this role, you would be typically responsible for ensuring that the
            computer-generated graphics integrate properly with the live-action footage, and proportions, movements and
            more all have a natural, seamless look and feel.
